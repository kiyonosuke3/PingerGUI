# PingerGUI

PingerGUI is a versatile GUI-based ping utility developed using the Python Flet framework and the `ping3` library. It allows you to ping multiple IP addresses simultaneously and view their real-time status and statistics.

## üöÄ Features

* **Support for Multiple Destination IP Addresses:** Ping several IP addresses concurrently.
* **Flexible IP Address Input:**
    * Single IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
    * IP address ranges (e.g., `192.168.1.1-10`)
    * CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`)
    * Comma-separated lists (e.g., `192.168.1.1,192.168.1.5`)
    * Combinations of the above are also supported.
* **Detailed Ping Configuration:**
    * **Timeout:** The timeout duration for each ping request (in seconds).
    * **Interval:** The waiting time between each ping request (in milliseconds).
    * **TTL (Time To Live):** The maximum number of hops a packet can traverse through routers.
    * **Packet Size:** The size of the ping packet to send.
* **Real-time Result Display:**
    * Sent Count
    * Received Count
    * Last Response Time
* **Start/Stop Ping:** Control ping operations with dedicated buttons.
* **Reset Statistics:** Clear statistics for individual destinations.
